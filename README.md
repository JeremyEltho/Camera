# 🎥 Webcam Viewer (Python + OpenCV)

Just a basic script I made to open the webcam and see if I could get a live feed going. Nothing too crazy.

## 🧠 How I learned it

Watched a quick YouTube tutorial (literally like 4 mins long) and tried doing it myself from scratch. Pretty straightforward once you get OpenCV set up.

## ⚙️ What it does

- Opens your default webcam 📷  
- Shows a live feed in a simple window  
- Press `q` to close it — no fancy exit buttons or anything

## 🛠️ How to run it

1. Make sure you’ve got OpenCV installed:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
